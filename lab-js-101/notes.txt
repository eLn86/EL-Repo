Fizz buzz is a game about division. Create a program that will iterate through numbers from 1 to 101
and log each number in the console.

In the loop everytime a number is divisible by 3,
instead of logging the number itself,
the word "fizz" should appear.

If the number is divisible by 5,
the word "buzz" should be logged.

If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5,
then the word "fizzbuzz" should be logged.
Hint: Go read about the Remainder Operator on MDN and figure out how to use it to simplify this problem.
